# Mosquito PBM Integration Work Flow
Home of the Mosquito PBM set up for the integration workflow.  

## Running the model 
If the conda environment (mosq-R) is set up in the `cimmid/miniconda3/` folder, you do not need to re-set up this environment. *If this is the first time running the model you will need to set up the conda environment. **See instructions below***

The basic comands to run the model are: 
```
conda activate /projects/cimmid/miniconda3/envs/mosq-R
bash run_mosq_toy.sh path_to_config_file location_id
```

## Setting up the virtual environment 
With a miniconda3 instance already set up in the `/projects/cimmid/` folder all that needs to be done is setting up the mosquito model environment. For further details on setting up the miniconda3 installation, there will be forthcoming instructions provided by the infrastructure team. 

In the `/projects/cimmid/miniconda3/` folder run 
```Bash
conda create --name mosq-R python=3.8
```

Even though we are setting up an R environment we need to install a python version to solve environments and at least install mamba and the R packages

Activate the `mosq-R` environment to continue installing packages
```
conda activate /projects/cimmid/miniconda3/envs/mosq-R
``` 
You should see something like this in your terminal 
```
(mosq-R) [kaitlynm@darwin-fe1 miniconda3]$
```

Next we will install mamba for faster solving of environments (significantly faster)
```
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
```

Then the R packages can be added one by one (or in a list)
```
mamba install -c conda-forge r-essentials r-logger r-subplex r-optimr -y
```

Each one of these `conda install` will ask you to confirm y/n to proceed to install after the environment solve if you want to stop this add a `-y` or `--yes` to auto proceed.
